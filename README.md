In this repository i will be focussing on projects focussing on various NLP tasks

Projects Added so far:
1)movie-reviews-nb-cnn-bilstm-pytorch.ipynb :  A Movie Review classification  task is implemented using various text classification techniques namely
  Gaussian Naive Bayes, 1D convolutions and Bi-LSTM based architectures.
2)news-language-model-transformer.ipynb : A simple Language model  created using pytorch's of Transformer Encoder using a part of the News Articles dataset. 
  Various inference modules are alos implemented.
3)spamclassification-pytorch-transformers.ipynb: Implemented a transformer encoder from scratch and used it for spam classification task.
