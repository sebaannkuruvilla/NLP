# NLP
In this repository I will be focussing on projects implementing various NLP tasks

## Projects Added so far:  
* movie-reviews-nb-cnn-bilstm-pytorch.ipynb :  A Movie Review classification  task is implemented using various text classification techniques below 
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
  - 1D convolutions for Text
  - Bi-LSTM
* news-language-model-transformer.ipynb : A simple Language model  created using pytorch's  Transformer Encoder using a part of the News Articles dataset. Various inference strategies are also implemented.
* spamclassification-pytorch-transformers.ipynb: Implemented a transformer encoder from scratch and used it for spam classification task.
